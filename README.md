upc_users_sync
==============



 * This module let share user information (additional fields) between master and 
 * slaves sites using curl (post) and several bakery functions.
 * All fields are hardcoded, so you have to erase them and add yours.
 * Theres a mapping function with rules on how to create the information to 
 * share, its pretty ease to understand.
